# Take home challenge Rewards App

### Summary:

The challenge is to implement a basic rewards redemption web app that allows a user to do the following:

- View their current reward points balance
- Browse available rewards
- Redeem rewards using their points
- See a history of their reward redemptions

### Tech Stack:

You can use whatever technologies you’d like. I will note that the main technologies at Thanx are React for the front-end, Ruby on Rails for the backend, and MySQL for the database

### Core Requirements:

#### Backend API:

Implement RESTful endpoints for the following:

- Retrieve a user’s current points balance
- Get a list of available rewards
- Allow users to redeem a reward
- Retrieve a user’s redemption history

#### Data Persistence:

Use a database of your choice to store the information as you deem fit

#### Interface:

Implement a simple interface to interact with the backend API. This could be a command-line interface (CLI) or a web-based interface (Preferred if your focus is on the frontend)

#### Documentation:

Provide clear documentation on how to set up and run the application

# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

- Ruby version

- System dependencies

- Configuration

- Database creation

- Database initialization

- How to run the test suite

- Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

- Deployment instructions

- ...
