### Summary:

The challenge is to implement a basic rewards redemption web app that allows a user to do the following:

- View their current reward points balance
- Browse available rewards
- Redeem rewards using their points
- See a history of their reward redemptions

### Tech Stack:

You can use whatever technologies youâ€™d like. I will note that the main technologies at Thanx are React for the front-end, Ruby on Rails for the backend, and MySQL for the database

### Core Requirements:

#### Backend API:

Implement RESTful endpoints for the following:

- Retrieve a userâ€™s current points balance
- Get a list of available rewards
- Allow users to redeem a reward
- Retrieve a userâ€™s redemption history

#### Data Persistence:

Use a database of your choice to store the information as you deem fit

#### Interface:

Implement a simple interface to interact with the backend API. This could be a command-line interface (CLI) or a web-based interface (Preferred if your focus is on the frontend)

#### Documentation:

Provide clear documentation on how to set up and run the application

## **Important Notes**

I use PointsEvent model with polymorphic association to implement rewards and bonuses, so in the `/api/v1/account/history` you could see all points transactions within your account. For now, application is Backend API only

## Run with Dev Containers

You can run this project using [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/) to ensure a consistent development environment. Follow the steps below to get started

### Prerequisites

- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)** installed locally on your machine
- A [compatible editor](https://containers.dev/supporting#editors), such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Cursor AI Editor](https://cursor.sh/), that supports Dev Containers
- The **[Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)** installed in your editor. _Note:_ This extension is typically pre-installed in VS Code and Cursor AI Editor

### Steps

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/artkirienko/rewards-app
   cd rewards-app
   ```
2. Open the project folder in your editor
3. When prompted, select "Reopen in Container" (or use the command palette: Dev Containers: Reopen in Container)
4. The Dev Container will build and configure the environment based on the provided .devcontainer configuration
5. Once the dev container setup is complete, open the terminal **within your editor** and run `bin/rails s`
6. You are ready for [Interacting with Backend API via command-line interface (CLI)](#interact-with-backend-api-via-command-line-interface-cli) ðŸŽ‰
7. Run tests: open the terminal **within your editor** and run `RAILS_ENV=test bin/rspec`

### Notes

- Ensure Docker is running before launching the Dev Container
- The `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file in this repository defines the container setup, including dependencies and tools
- It is recommended to monitor the container setup process by clicking "Connecting to Dev Container (show log)" in your editor. This can help troubleshoot any issues that arise

## Run with Docker and Docker-Compose

### Prerequisites

- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)** must be installed locally on your machine

### Steps

Run the following command to build and start the application:

```bash
docker-compose -f .devdocker/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

You are now ready to [interact with the Backend API via the command-line interface (CLI)](#interact-with-backend-api-via-command-line-interface-cli) ðŸŽ‰

### Run Tests

To run tests, open a new terminal window or tab and execute the following command from the project directory:

```bash
docker-compose -f .devdocker/docker-compose.yml exec -e RAILS_ENV=test app bin/rspec
```

## Run

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your machine:

- MySQL 8
- Ruby 3.4.2
- Rails 8.0.2

### Steps

Run the setup script to initialize the application:

```bash
bin/setup
```

You are now ready to [interact with the Backend API via the command-line interface (CLI)](#interact-with-backend-api-via-command-line-interface-cli) ðŸŽ‰

### Run Tests

To execute tests, run:

```bash
RAILS_ENV=test bin/rspec
```

## Codestyle

```bash
bin/rubocop
```

## TODO

- Add code coverage using Codecov
- Update `Devise::JWT::RevocationStrategies::Null` to a more robust strategy
- Explore modern alternatives to Devise/Devise JWT
- Implement authorization and an admin dashboard
- Move some logic from controllers to JSON view templates using tools like Jbuilder, Oj, or Fast JSON
- Add pagination using Pagy, a modern gem, or implement it from scratch (offset + limit)
- Develop a TypeScript React.js frontend using either esbuild or Webpacker
- Add an animation when the user clicks the redeem button
- Integrate CodeClimate for code quality analysis
- Save cURL instructions as a Postman suite or create end-to-end tests
