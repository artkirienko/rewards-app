# Take home challenge Rewards App

### Summary:

The challenge is to implement a basic rewards redemption web app that allows a user to do the following:

- View their current reward points balance
- Browse available rewards
- Redeem rewards using their points
- See a history of their reward redemptions

### Tech Stack:

You can use whatever technologies youâ€™d like. I will note that the main technologies at Thanx are React for the front-end, Ruby on Rails for the backend, and MySQL for the database

### Core Requirements:

#### Backend API:

Implement RESTful endpoints for the following:

- Retrieve a userâ€™s current points balance
- Get a list of available rewards
- Allow users to redeem a reward
- Retrieve a userâ€™s redemption history

#### Data Persistence:

Use a database of your choice to store the information as you deem fit

#### Interface:

Implement a simple interface to interact with the backend API. This could be a command-line interface (CLI) or a web-based interface (Preferred if your focus is on the frontend)

#### Documentation:

Provide clear documentation on how to set up and run the application

## Run with Dev Containers

You can run this project using [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/) to ensure a consistent development environment. Follow the steps below to get started

### Prerequisites

- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)** installed locally on your machine
- A [compatible editor](https://containers.dev/supporting#editors), such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Cursor AI Editor](https://cursor.sh/), that supports Dev Containers
- The **[Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)** installed in your editor. _Note:_ This extension is typically pre-installed in VS Code and Cursor AI Editor

### Steps

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/artkirienko/rewards-app
   cd rewards-app
   ```
2. Open the project folder in your editor
3. When prompted, select "Reopen in Container" (or use the command palette: Dev Containers: Reopen in Container)
4. The Dev Container will build and configure the environment based on the provided .devcontainer configuration
5. Once the dev container setup is complete, open the terminal **within your editor** and run `bin/rails s`
6. You are ready for Interacting with Backend API via command-line interface (CLI) ðŸŽ‰
7. Run tests: open the terminal **within your editor** and run `RAILS_ENV=test bin/rspec`

### Notes

- Ensure Docker is running before launching the Dev Container
- The `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file in this repository defines the container setup, including dependencies and tools
- I recommend clicking "Connecting to Dev Container (show log)" in your editor to monitor the container setup process and troubleshoot any issues

## Run with Docker and Docker-Compose

### Prerequisites

- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)** installed locally on your machine

### Steps

```bash
docker-compose -f .devdocker/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

You are ready for Interacting with Backend API via command-line interface (CLI) ðŸŽ‰

### Run tests

Open new terminal window or tab and run from within project directory

```bash
docker-compose -f .devdocker/docker-compose.yml exec -e RAILS_ENV=test app bin/rspec
```

## Run

### Prerequisites

MySQL 8, Ruby 3.4.2, Rails 8.0.2

### Steps

```
bin/setup
```

You are ready for Interacting with Backend API via command-line interface (CLI) ðŸŽ‰

### Run tests

```bash
RAILS_ENV=test bin/rspec
```

## Interact with Backend API via command-line interface (CLI)

As soon as you have Rewards App up and running

## TODO

- code coverage, codecov
- update Devise::JWT::RevocationStrategies::Null to better strategy
- check for modern devise/devise jwt alternatives
- authorization & admin dashboard
- jbuilder, oj, fast-json
- pagination with pagy, any modern gem or from scratch (offset + limit)
- typescript react.js frontend via esbuild vs webpacker
- when user clicks redeem button, play animation
- codeclimate
- save curl instructions as Postman suite or create end-to-end test
